# Polynomial Addition Using Linked Lists in C

This project demonstrates how to perform **polynomial addition** using **singly linked lists** in C.

## 📘 Description

Polynomials are represented using linked lists where each node contains:
- A coefficient (`coeff`)
- An exponent (`expo`)
- A pointer to the next node

This program takes two polynomials as input from the user, adds them, and displays the resulting polynomial.

## 🛠️ Features

- Dynamic creation and insertion of polynomial terms
- Handles polynomials of different lengths and orders
- Adds like terms (same exponent) correctly
- Displays the resulting polynomial

## 📂 File Structure

- `main.c` — The full source code with all functions included
